## Description
This Python project analyzes product usage data from a SQL database. It extracts data related to user interactions with different product features, calculates key usage metrics (such as feature usage frequency and engagement rate), and visualizes the results through various charts.

The main goal of this project is to help businesses identify trends and patterns in feature usage, enabling product optimization and better decision-making.

## Key Features
Connect to SQL Database: The script connects to a MySQL database using user-provided credentials.
Feature Usage Frequency: Analyzes how frequently each feature is used by users.
Feature Engagement Rate: Measures the engagement rate for each feature (percentage of unique users who used a feature).
Session Count per Feature: Tracks how many unique sessions involved each feature.
Data Visualization: Visualizes the feature usage and engagement with bar charts using matplotlib and seaborn.
## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python packages:

pandas: For data manipulation.
sqlalchemy: To connect to the SQL database.
mysql-connector-python: For MySQL database connection.
matplotlib: For plotting the data.
seaborn: For enhanced visualizations.
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

pip install pandas sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python matplotlib seaborn
Setup Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/IdrissBado/roduct-Usage-Analytics.git
Step 2: Database Configuration
You'll need to configure the connection details for your SQL database. Open the product_usage_analytics.py file and update the following section with your database credentials:


# Database connection details (replace with your credentials)
db_host = 'your_database_host'
db_user = 'your_database_user'
db_password = 'your_database_password'
db_name = 'your_database_name'
Step 3: Extracting Data
The script assumes that your database has a table (user_activity) containing the following columns:

user_id: Unique identifier for each user.
feature: The feature that the user interacted with.
session_id: A unique identifier for the user session.
timestamp: The timestamp of when the interaction occurred.
If your table schema differs, you may need to adjust the SQL query in the extract_data function to match your table's structure.

Step 4: Running the Script
Once the database connection is set up and the credentials are updated, you can run the script using the following command:

python product_usage_analytics.py
This will:

Connect to the database.
Extract the data for feature usage.
Generate visualizations of the data:
Feature Usage Frequency (how often each feature was used).
Feature Engagement Rate (the percentage of unique users who used a feature).
Session Count per Feature (the number of unique sessions involving each feature).
Step 5: Viewing the Results
The visualizations will be displayed in the output as bar charts. They provide a clear view of how users interact with different features of your product, helping you identify areas for optimization.

# Example Output
After running the script, you will see the following visualizations:

Feature Usage Frequency: A bar chart showing the frequency of each feature usage.
Feature Engagement Rate: A bar chart showing the percentage of unique users engaging with each feature.
Session Count per Feature: A bar chart showing the number of sessions that involved each feature.
